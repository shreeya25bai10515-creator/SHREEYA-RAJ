# FinGuard: Project Statement

## Problem Statement

Modern individuals face significant challenges in managing their personal finances effectively while protecting themselves from increasing financial fraud. Most people use multiple banking apps, credit cards, and digital payment methods, making it difficult to maintain a consolidated view of their financial health. At the same time, sophisticated fraud schemes target digital transactions, often going undetected until substantial damage occurs.

Existing solutions are fragmented - budgeting apps focus on expense tracking while security tools concentrate on fraud prevention. This forces users to manage separate systems, leading to inconsistent data, delayed fraud detection, and inefficient financial management. There is a clear need for an integrated platform that provides comprehensive financial oversight with built-in security measures.
